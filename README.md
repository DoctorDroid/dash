# Demo Dash project

The primary goal of this small project is to provide myself and others a working plotly dash application from which to build on top of. The architecture is minimal, allowing fast and easy customization. WIP.

## Changing stylesheet

The stylesheet names come from [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/). Use the name of any theme you want in place of the currently existing one.
